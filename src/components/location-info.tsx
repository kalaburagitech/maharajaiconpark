              Devanahalli, situated in the northern part of Bengaluru, is
              evolving into a satellite town and a growing real estate hub. The
              micro market's advantageous location and proximity to Nandi Hills
              along the commerce route that connects Karnataka with the northern
              region have aided the region's development.

              Following the establishment of Kempegowda International Airport,
              the micro market is attracting real estate investors due to the
              availability of large land parcels, attracting both local and
              global investors.

              NH 44, a six-lane signal-free road that connects to the Outer Ring
